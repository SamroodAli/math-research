# Types of Numbers

In mathematics, numbers can be classified into several categories based on their properties. Here are some of the most common types:

## 1. Natural Numbers

Natural numbers are the set of positive integers starting from 1 and going upward indefinitely. They are used for counting and ordering.

### Properties
- Always positive
- No fractions or decimals

## 2. Whole Numbers

Whole numbers are similar to natural numbers but include 0. This set is useful for representing counts that can include a zero value.

### Properties
- Includes zero
- All whole numbers are non-negative integers

## 3. Integers
Integers include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts. They extend the number line in both the positive and negative directions.

### Properties
- Includes positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero
- No fractions or decimals

## 4. Rational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. They include fractions and whole numbers.

### Properties
- Can be positive, negative, or zero
- Includes whole numbers and fractions 

## 5. Irrational Numbers
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions go on forever without repeating.

### Examples
- pi (approximately 3.14159...)
- square root of 2 (approximately 1.41421...)

### Properties
- Non-terminating and non-repeating decimal expansion
- Not countable (there are infinitely many)

## 6. Real Numbers

Real numbers include all the rational and irrational numbers. They can be found on the number line and represent quantities in continuous spaces.

### Properties
- Includes integers, fractions, whole numbers, and irrational numbers
- Can be positive, negative, or zero

## Conclusion

Understanding these types of numbers is fundamental in mathematics. They serve as the building blocks for more complex mathematical concepts and operations. Each category has unique properties and applications that are essential for various fields, including science, engineering, and finance.
